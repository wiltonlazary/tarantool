-- Tests on data integrity after dump of memory runs or range
-- compaction.
--
-- The aim is to test vy_write_iterator. There are several combinations
-- of various commands that can occur:
--   1) delete followed by upsert : write iterator should convert
--      upsert to replace (insert)
--   2) upsert followed by delete: the upsert is filtered out,
--      delete can be filtered out or not depending on whether it's
--      compaction (filtered out) or dump (preserved)
--   3) upsert followed by upsert: two upserts are folded together
--      into one
--   4) upsert followed by replace: upsert is replaced
--   5) replace followed by upsert: two commands are folded
--      into a single replace with upsert ops applied
--   6) replace followed by delete:
--      both are eliminated in case of compaction;
--      replace is filtered out if it's dump
--   7) delete followed by replace: delete is filtered out
--   8) replace followed by replace: the first replace is filtered
--      out
--   9) single upsert (for completeness)
--   10) single replace (for completeness)
