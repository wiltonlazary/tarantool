 * Recovery subsystem
 * ------------------
 *
 * A facade of the recovery subsystem is struct recovery.
 *
 * Depending on the configuration, start-up parameters, the
 * actual task being performed, the recovery can be
 * in a different state.
 *
 * The main factors influencing recovery state are:
 * - temporal: whether or not the instance is just booting
 *   from a snapshot, is in 'local hot standby mode', or
 *   is already accepting requests
 * - task based: whether it's a master process,
 *   snapshot saving process or a replication relay.
 *
 * Depending on the above factors, recovery can be in two main
 * operation modes: "read mode", recovering in-memory state
 * from existing data, and "write mode", i.e. recording on
 * disk changes of the in-memory state.
 *
 * Let's enumerate all possible distinct states of recovery:
 *
 * Read mode
 * ---------
 * IR - initial recovery, initiated right after server start:
 * reading data from the snapshot and existing WALs
 * and restoring the in-memory state
 * IRR - initial replication relay mode, reading data from
 * existing WALs (xlogs) and sending it to the client.
 *
 * HS - standby mode, entered once all existing WALs are read:
 * following the WAL directory for all changes done by the master
 * and updating the in-memory state
 * RR - replication relay, following the WAL directory for all
 * changes done by the master and sending them to the
 * replica
 *
 * Write mode
 * ----------
 * M - master mode, recording in-memory state changes in the WAL
 * R - replica mode, receiving changes from the master and
 * recording them in the WAL
 *
 * The following state transitions are possible/supported:
 *
 * recovery_init() -> IR | IRR # recover()
 * IR -> HS         # recovery_follow_local()
 * IRR -> RR        # recovery_follow_local()
 * HS -> M          # recovery_finalize()
 * M -> R           # remote_start()
 * R -> M           # remote_stop()
